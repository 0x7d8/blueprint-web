### **What are scripts?**

Extension scripts are advanced collections of commands allowing extensions to extend parts of Pterodactyl that are out of Blueprint's scope. Due to the nature of the complexity related to these scripts, they are advised against.

Scripts can **prevent extensions from being listed** on the [extension browse list](../browse) if they do not meet **all of the following requirements**:

- Scripts <u>should never</u> cause conflicts with other extensions respecting these guidelines.
  - This means extensions are not allowed to overwrite files outside of the scope of their own extensions and must use search-and-replace instead.
- Scripts must stay <u>within the Pterodactyl instance</u> and not edit anything outside of the panel's webserver folder without user consent.
- Extensions must undo all of their changes when removing the extension.
- Updating extensions utilizing scripts must not break their modifications.
- Scripts should use **environment variables** or [placeholders](?page=documentation/placeholders) for detecting the webserver folder.
  - [Placeholders](?page=documentation/placeholders) are <u>not available</u> for `update.sh` and `export.sh`.

**Export scripts are free from (most of) these limitations** as they are specifically made to help the developer automate actions upon export. As long as you don't cause permanent damages through export scripts, you should be fine.

### **Environment variables**

These variables can be used anywhere in your scripts and are automatically assigned the correct value by Blueprint.

##### Baseline

<!-- $ENGINE -->

`$ENGINE`\
Codename of the engine currently handling the extension.

<!-- $EXTENSION_IDENTIFIER -->

`$EXTENSION_IDENTIFIER`\

<!-- $EXTENSION_VERSION -->

`$EXTENSION_VERSION`\
Provides the extension's version.

<!-- $EXTENSION_TARGET -->

`$EXTENSION_TARGET`\
Provides the extension's defined target version, not to be confused with the version the extension is currently being installed on.

<!-- $PTERODACTYL_DIRECTORY -->

`$PTERODACTYL_DIRECTORY`\
Path towards the Pterodactyl webserver folder, commonly `/var/www/pterodactyl`.
