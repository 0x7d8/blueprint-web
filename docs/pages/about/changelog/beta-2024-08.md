#### Changes
- Assets in `.blueprint/assets` have been resorted to simplify searching for Blueprint branding assets.
- Add new assets (including the new retro icons) to `.blueprint/assets` and remove older ones.
- Outdated stylesheet/scripts (due to browser cache) prevention has been completely reworked and should no longer require any user intervention.
- Add new `importScript()` and `importStylesheet()` APIs to [BlueprintExtensionLibrary](?page=documentation/$blueprint) that work with the new cache refresh rework.
- Add new `bp:cache` artisan command to flush script and stylesheet cache.
- Add new [Components.yml](?page=documentation/componentsyml) APIs for extending the "Dashboard". (`BeforeContent` and `AfterContent`)
- [Custom controllers](?page=developing-extensions/Custom-controllers) can now utilize 3 additional HTTP methods (`PUT`, `DELETE` and `OPTIONS`).

<br/>

#### Bugfixes
- Database migrations did **not run** after completing extension installation transactions.
- Users using Bash as their shell experienced errors with autocompletion on `-install` and `-remove`.
- Blueprint's `bp:sync` command used the admin version of [BlueprintExtensionLibrary](?page=documentation/$blueprint) instead of the console version.

<br/>

#### Breaking Changes
- Blueprint no longer drops older database migrations from before 02/03/2024 `(dd/mm/yyyy)`. Updating from installations before this date might require manual intervention.
