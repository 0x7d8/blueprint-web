# beta-2025-02
<br/>

#### Changes
- Improved asset rebuilding speeds through caching (2-4x faster).
- Implement `-watch`, an experimental new tool that rebuilds extensions on every file save and sets up `yarn watch` where needed.
- Add component path aliases for Blueprint. (`@blueprint`)

<br/>

#### Bugfixes
- Developer mode flag value was sent twice in the same telemetry request.
- `ISO-8859-6` system encoding caused issues with extensions utilizing [Components.yml](?page=documentation/componentsyml)'s navigation routes and [Console.yml](?page=documentation/consoleyml)'s artisan commands.

<br/>

#### Breaking Changes
- Since `beta-2024-12`, Blueprint stores environment-related variables in a `.blueprintrc` file. This version officially deprecates storing said variables inside of the `blueprint.sh` file and will attempt automatic migration to a `.blueprintrc` file.
