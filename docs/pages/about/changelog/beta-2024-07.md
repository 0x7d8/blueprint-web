#### Changes
- Add bash autocompletion which can be initialized by adding `source blueprint` to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` if using zsh).
- Add support for installing and removing multiple extensions at once. This implementation also only runs resource-heavy commands once if any of the installed extensions require it (such as webpack asset rebuilding).
- Move libraries required by the `blueprint.sh` file into `scripts/libraries` and symlink the old location.
- Move commands into their own files under `scripts/commands`.

#### Bugfixes
- Remove command was not functional - this has now been fixed.
- Input validation was done incorrectly on Blueprint's admin page causing validation errors when toggling developer mode or telemetry.

#### Breaking Changes
- None yet.
